                    <li>This tool helps you find two letter chords that are infrequently occuring in words so that you
                        don't
                        accidentally trigger chords.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This tool looks at your uploaded chord map and provides some statistics (number of chords,
                        breakdown by number of letters 2 letter/3 letter ... etc.)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This tool looks at your uploaded chord map and a text and finds common words and phrases in the
                        text that you don't have chords for.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This tool looks at a text and identifies all of the partial anagrams. Partial anagrams (like
                        tough and thought) are usually words that you need special attention to for choosing chord maps
                        since they share the same overall letters.</li>

                        for practicing in Monkeytype or <a href="https://charatyping.com/">CharaTyping</a> or let you
                        practice right on the page with chord hints.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This tool will take an uploaded text file of words or list of words typed in and attempt to
                        generate a chord library file for them using a variety of rules. Originally from
                        https://github.com/bittujoju/charachorder</li>

                        Sometimes it can be helpful to try to look closer at the timing that you are pressing and
                        releasing keys to diganose what you might be doing wrong in a chord if it isn't triggering. This
                        tool, developed by Tangent Chang (andy23512) on the CharaChorder Discord, can help with that.
