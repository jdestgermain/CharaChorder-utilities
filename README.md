# CharaChorder Utilities

Welcome to the CharaChorder Utilities project! This project contains a set of tools for CharaChorder users, including:

- Count Bigrams: a tool that helps you find infrequently occurring two letter chords to avoid accidental triggering.
- Chord Statistics: a tool that provides statistics on your uploaded chord map, including the number of chords and breakdown by number of letters.
- ChordFinder: a tool that looks at your uploaded chord map and a text and finds common words and phrases in the text that you don't have chords for.
- Anagrams: this tool looks at a text and identifies all of the partial anagrams. Partial anagrams (like tough and thought) are usually words that you need special attention for choosing chord maps since they share the same overall letters.
- Practice: this tool lets you copy the chords from your chord map into a string for practicing in Monkeytype or CharaTyping
- CC1 Chord Generator: this tool will take an uploaded text file of words and attempt to generate a chord library file for them using a variety of rules. Originally from https://github.com/bittujoju/charachorder
- Chord Timing Diagnostic: Sometimes it can be helpful to try to look closer at the timing that you are pressing and releasing keys to diganose what you might be doing wrong in a chord if it isn't triggering. This tool, developed by Tangent Chang (andy23512) on the CharaChorder Discord, can help with that.
